When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  when I want to share it with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	so you can keep track of the changes made 
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	forks: it's like clone but on github, you use it one when you are not a contributor to a repository and you want to make changes to it
	clones: to get a repository from github to your own computer, use it when you want to have the repository on your own computer and easily make changes on it
